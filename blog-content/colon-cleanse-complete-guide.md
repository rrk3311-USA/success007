## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How quickly will I notice results?
**A:** Senna typically works within 6-12 hours. You may notice bowel movements within the first day. Fuller digestive benefits develop over the first week.

### Q: Can I take this every day long-term?
**A:** No. While the fiber and probiotics are safe for daily use, senna is intended for short-term use only (1-2 weeks). Long-term daily laxative use can lead to dependency. Use periodically, not continuously.

### Q: Will this cause cramping or discomfort?
**A:** Some people experience mild cramping, especially initially. This is normal as the colon contracts. If cramping is severe, reduce dose or discontinue use. Taking with food may reduce cramping.

### Q: Is this safe for weight loss?
**A:** While improved elimination may result in some weight loss, colon cleanse products are not weight loss supplements. Any weight lost is primarily water and waste, not fat. Don't rely on laxatives for weight management.

### Q: Can I take this with other supplements?
**A:** Generally yes, but senna can affect absorption of medications and supplements. Take other supplements/medications at different times of day (at least 2 hours apart).

### Q: Will I be running to the bathroom all day?
**A:** You'll likely have 2-3 bowel movements versus your usual 1 (or every few days). You won't have uncontrollable urgency, but plan to have bathroom access.

### Q: What if I don't have a bowel movement?
**A:** If no effect after 24 hours, you may increase to 3 capsules (don't exceed recommended dose). Ensure adequate water intake. If constipation persists beyond 3 days, consult healthcare provider.

### Q: Can this help with IBS?
**A:** Some IBS-C (constipation-predominant) sufferers find benefit. However, IBS requires medical management. Consult your gastroenterologist before using if you have IBS.

### Q: Is this habit-forming?
**A:** Senna can become habit-forming if used daily long-term, as the colon may become dependent on stimulation. Use short-term only and focus on dietary fiber for long-term regularity.

### Q: Will this clean out old waste in my colon?
**A:** While marketed cleanses claim to remove "pounds of old fecal matter," there's limited evidence for significant accumulation in healthy people. This formula supports regular elimination and colon health, which is beneficial, but dramatic cleansing claims are often exaggerated.
