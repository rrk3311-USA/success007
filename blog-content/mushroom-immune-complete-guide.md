## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I take mushroom supplements every day?
**A:** Yes, medicinal mushrooms are designed for daily use. They work cumulatively over time, and consistent use provides best results for immune support.

### Q: Will mushrooms interfere with my medications?
**A:** Mushrooms are generally safe with most medications. However, if you take immunosuppressants, blood thinners, or diabetes medications, consult your doctor about potential interactions.

### Q: Can this prevent me from getting sick?
**A:** While no supplement can guarantee you won't get sick, mushroom immune support significantly enhances your body's defenses and may reduce frequency and severity of infections.

### Q: Are these psychedelic mushrooms?
**A:** No! These are medicinal mushrooms (Reishi, Chaga, etc.), not psilocybin-containing "magic mushrooms." They're legal, non-psychoactive health supplements.

### Q: Do I need to cycle off mushrooms or take breaks?
**A:** No cycling is necessary. Unlike some supplements that require breaks, medicinal mushrooms can be taken continuously for ongoing support.

### Q: Can I give this to my kids?
**A:** This formula is designed for adults. While mushrooms are generally safe, consult a pediatrician for children's immune support needs.

### Q: Will this help with allergies?
**A:** Some mushrooms (particularly Reishi) have antihistamine and immune-modulating properties that may help with allergic responses. Results vary individually.

### Q: How is this different from eating culinary mushrooms?
**A:** Medicinal mushrooms contain higher concentrations of active compounds (beta-glucans, triterpenes) than culinary varieties. The extraction and concentration process makes them more potent than food mushrooms.

### Q: Can I take this if I have an autoimmune disease?
**A:** Consult your rheumatologist or immunologist. Mushrooms modulate (balance) rather than simply stimulate immunity, but professional guidance is important for autoimmune conditions.

### Q: Does this work immediately, or do I need to take it ongoing?
**A:** Mushroom benefits are cumulative. Some effects (like Cordyceps energy) may be noticed within weeks, but immune benefits build over 4-8 weeks of consistent use.
