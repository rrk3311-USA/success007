## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What does sea moss taste like in capsules?
**A:** You won't taste it! The vegetable capsules mask any ocean flavor. If you open a capsule, it has a mild seaweed scent, but taken whole, there's no taste.

### Q: Can Irish Sea Moss help with weight loss?
**A:** Irish Sea Moss supports healthy thyroid function, which regulates metabolism. If thyroid function is suboptimal, supporting it may help weight management. It's not a weight loss pill, but optimal mineral status supports healthy metabolism.

### Q: Is there enough iodine in this to affect my thyroid medication?
**A:** The formula contains 150mcg iodine, which is the recommended daily amount. If you take thyroid medication, consult your doctor, as iodine intake can affect dosing requirements.

### Q: Can I take this if I'm allergic to shellfish?
**A:** Irish Sea Moss is algae/seaweed, not shellfish. However, if you have severe seafood allergies, consult your allergist, as cross-contamination is theoretically possible during harvesting.

### Q: Will this detox heavy metals from my body?
**A:** Iodine and chlorophyll in sea vegetables support the body's natural detoxification processes, and there's some evidence for heavy metal binding. However, it's not a chelation therapy. It supports natural detox pathways.

### Q: How is this different from eating seaweed?
**A:** This provides a concentrated, standardized dose of sea moss plus synergistic herbs (bladderwrack, burdock) and enhanced absorption (BioPerine). It's more convenient and potent than eating seaweed salad.

### Q: Can children take Irish Sea Moss?
**A:** While sea moss is a whole food, this supplement is formulated for adults. Consult a pediatrician for children's mineral supplementation needs.

### Q: Will this make my thyroid overactive?
**A:** At 150mcg iodine (the RDA), this is unlikely to cause hyperthyroidism in healthy people. However, those with existing thyroid conditions should consult their doctor.

### Q: Can I take this while pregnant?
**A:** Pregnant women have increased iodine needs (220mcg vs. 150mcg normally). While sea moss is a whole food, consult your obstetrician about iodine supplementation during pregnancy, as both deficiency and excess can affect the baby.

### Q: How long until I notice benefits?
**A:** Energy improvements may be noticed within 1-2 weeks. Skin, hair, nail improvements typically take 4-6 weeks. Immune benefits are more preventive and harder to quantify but develop with consistent use.
