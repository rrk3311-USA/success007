Transform Your Eye Health Naturally

Sclera White is a premium dietary supplement specifically formulated to promote brighter, healthier-looking eyes. Enriched with clinically-studied ingredients including Eyebright, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin, this powerful formula supports ocular tissue health while helping to reduce eye yellowing and enhance natural eye brightness.

Key Benefits:

Premium Ingredient Formula:

Eyebright Extract - Traditionally used for centuries to support eye health, reduce inflammation, and soothe eye irritation. Known for its natural properties that help maintain clear, bright eyes.

Zeaxanthin - Works synergistically with lutein to protect eye tissues from oxidative damage and support healthy vision.

Bilberry Extract - Rich in anthocyanins and antioxidants that support eye health, improve night vision, and promote healthy blood circulation to the eyes.

Why Choose Sclera White?

In today's digital age, our eyes are constantly exposed to blue light from screens, environmental stressors, and aging factors that can cause eye yellowing and dullness. Sclera White provides comprehensive nutritional support to help maintain the natural brightness and health of your eyes from within.

Unlike temporary eye drops, Sclera White works at the cellular level to support long-term eye health and appearance. Our unique blend of vitamins, minerals, and botanical extracts nourishes your eyes with the nutrients they need to stay healthy, vibrant, and bright.
