            <h2>What This Product Does</h2>
            <p>Liver Cleanse Pills support your liver's natural detoxification processes. The formula combines 
            milk thistle, which helps protect liver cells from toxins, with dandelion root that assists bile 
            production. Together, these ingredients support the liver's ability to process toxins and maintain 
            healthy function. Artichoke extract aids digestion and liver function, while turmeric and ginger 
            help maintain a healthy inflammatory response in the liver.</p>
